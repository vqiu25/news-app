## How to Run

### **Step Zero:** Download Expo Go

Expo Go is where our app will be rendered. You can find the IOS and Android versions [here](https://expo.dev/go). 

### **Step One:** Clone the Repository

```
git clone <URL>
```

### **Step Two:** `npm install`

In the root directory, perform the following:

```
npm install
```

### **Step Three:** `npx expo start`

Now perform:

```
npx expo start
```

### **Step Four:** Scan the QR Code

A QR code will now appear in the terminal. Scan it, and it will redirect you to Expo Go. The app should load.
* **Android**: Open Expo Go and scan the QR code
* **IOS**: Open the camera app and scan the QR code

The QR code should look something like this. Do **not** use the following QR code as you must generate a new one each time.
